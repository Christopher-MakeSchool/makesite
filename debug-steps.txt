## ?s

### What error message (if any) is there?

### What line number is causing the error?

### What is the actual output vs. the expected?

### What assumption(s) the developer has made?

## Techniques

- Trace Backward: If there is a specific line number causing the error
- Trace Forward: If you aren't sure which line is causing the error
- Divide and Conquer: If there are multiple areas which may have caused the error

----

### Trace backward, figure out which line of code is producing the error.

  Then, work backwards one line at a time until you find the source of the bad data. \
  Use this technique when...

    - The error is thrown from a known location
    - You understand the program well enough to know what it's supposed to be doing

### Trace forward, start at the beginning of your program.

  Then, work forwards one line at a time and verify that your mental model matches the result, using a debugger or log statements. \
  Use this technique when...

    - The problem line isn’t known
    - You can't narrow down the problem to one specific area of the code

### To divide and conquer:

  Identify different code sections that could have caused the error \
  Use breakpoints or log statements at the boundaries to test which area is the problem \
  Focus your efforts on that area using Trace Forward or Trace Backward \
  Use this technique when...

    - There are multiple areas where the error could have come from

## Example Sketch

```python3
  #! Plan OF Attack
  '''
  First, Skim the Functions main and contains_3_consecutive from above, what do you expect to be outputed?
    - expected output
      - 
      - output would be:
      - 
  Next, Run the code in the terminal with pyhron3 exercise-1.py to view the Actual Output
    - actual
      
  Looks Like we got a call to the Traceback, can you spot what the error message is?
    - 
  Can you find what line(s) may be causing said error?
      - 
      - 
    - 
  What can you deduce about the cause of the error?
    -
